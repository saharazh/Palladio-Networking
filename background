**Background and the dataset** <br /> 
The Canadian government imposed a head tax on Chinese immigrants entering Canada between 1885 and 1923 in order to restrict immigration. While a print register was created to keep track of the influx of migrants, the detailed recording resulted in years of demographic information about the immigrants that has become a rich source of data for researchers. For more details about the background information, please refer to the [Research](http://blogs.ubc.ca/szhang/research/) page. <br />
