## Background and the dataset

The Canadian government imposed a head tax on Chinese immigrants entering Canada between 1885 and 1923 to restrict immigration. While a print register was created to keep track of the influx of migrants, the detailed recording resulted in years of demographic information about the immigrants that has become a rich source of data for researchers. For more details about the historical background and the dataset, please refer to [Hacking the Historical Data: Register of Chinese Immigrants to Canada, 1886-1949, an OSF project](https://osf.io/9zr6f/).

In the spreadsheet, each row corresponds to an immigrant. Variables (columns) include demographic information such as name, age, height, gender, profession, etc., as well as destination and origin (mostly from a province in Southern China, namely Guangdong), which is broken down into two geographic levels: county and village.

There was a critical issue with the data, though: they were captured in idiosyncratic dialects of the immigrants, resulting in English variations of place names and titles. The inconsistencies, thanks to a project spearheaded by UBC Asian Library, were partly corrected: all the county names and a large portion of the village names were normalized.

Since the entire dataset contains over 90,000 records, I filtered the data to focus on one county, Zhongshan, in order to avoid making the visualization overcrowded or illegible. You can [download the filtered the dataset of Zhongshan](https://osf.io/epkh3/) for the following steps.
