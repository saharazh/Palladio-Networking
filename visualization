**The visualization produced by Palladio** ![](http://blogs.ubc.ca/szhang/files/2018/08/palladio-animated.gif) 
This graph was born out of my interest in studying at the granular level of _village_, which I believe served as a closely-knit clan 
or social unit, to examine migration patterns. Each number represents an origin village in China where immigrants were from, while 
the immigrants’ destinations are spelled (with darker shade). Wherever a village node is connected to a destination node, it means 
there were immigrants originating from the village in China who chose that destination in Canada. <br />
