## The visualization produced by Palladio


The normalization of village names opens up the opportunity to explore the migration patterns of the early Chinese immigrants at much greater granularity. I was interested to get down to **village**, which I believe could serve as a closely-knit clan or social unit, and examine migration patterns.

To that end, I followed a few steps to produce a networkshop visualization using Palladio:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Filter the original data to one county ( I used Zhongshan as an example) 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Go to Palladio, click on Start, and then “Create a new project” from the left

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Drag and drop the csv file to the middle box, and click on upload 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.Check if the types of the variables have been recognized correctly

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.Click on the tab “Graph”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.Choose the variable “MatchCH_ID” (which is the normalized villages of the immigrants’ origin) as “Source”, and “New_Dest” (which is the immigrants’ destinations in Canada) as “Target”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.Check the box “Highlight” so that source and target nodes will be differentiated by two different shades

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.Check the box “Size nodes”

And boom! We’ve got the visualization:

An initial interpretation of the graph: 

Each number represents an origin village in China where immigrants were from, while the immigrants’ destinations are spelled (with darker shade). Wherever a village node is connected to a destination node (speaking of network jargon, this is an “**edge**”), it means there were immigrants originating from the village in China who chose that destination in Canada.
If you feel confused over these jargons, such as **node** and **edge**, you may take a quick look at this [guide](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gephi-palladio/content/04_definitions.html) for the basic concepts of network analysis. 

Now here comes the more interesting part- let’s try to dig deeper into the graph.
