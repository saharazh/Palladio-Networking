## What has emerged from the graph


Now that the meaning of node size is sorted out, if we take a step back, we’ll be able to get a bird’s-eye view of the graph. It tells us a wealth of information on a few aspects, all at a glance:

1) The edges indicate which village(s) are linked to which destination(s).

2) Node size (weighted degree) indicates the frequencies of each village and destination.

3) Combining these two, constellations of villages emerge, showing similar migration patterns in terms of where the immigrants went. For example, the villages that sent immigrants to both Vancouver and Victoria are situated in the middle, while the villages connecting to a wider range of destinations are placed in the peripheral areas.

Isn’t this wonderful?

And what’s most thrilling is that a cluster of villages jumped out at me: these villages show similar migration patterns, are connected to a relatively large number of destinations, and sent relatively more immigrants— **could they be geographically close**?
